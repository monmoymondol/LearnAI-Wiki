I'll create a website for a personal learning AI chatbot that  text-only interaction. This will include an AI assistant interface, conversation history, and responsive design.

About a user wants this below recuirements :

1. A website for a personal learning AI chatbot
2. Text-only interaction (no voice)
3. It should be focused on learning

And 
It's Work procitude should be :
When a user sends a message, the chatbot queries Wikipedia’s API for a matching article summary.
If a relevant article is found, the summary is displayed as the AI’s response.
If no article is found or an error occurs, the chatbot falls back to predefined educational responses.
Quick suggestion buttons help users start conversations on popular learning topics.
The UI is fully responsive and styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern look.

Now,,

I need to create:

1. A clean, modern UI for a chatbot
2. Text input area
3. Conversation display area
4. Simple AI responses (I'll simulate basic responses for learning purposes)
5. Responsive design for different screen sizes
6. A single HTML file with all CSS and JavaScript included

To create a website chat with a personal learning AI that connects to Wikipedia, I would build a chatbot interface on the user's site and integrate it with Wikipedia’s content by using Wikipedia’s public APIs (like the MediaWiki API) to fetch real-time information. The AI can process user queries, send requests to Wikipedia to retrieve relevant articles or summaries, and then present that information conversationally. This setup typically involves:

A frontend chat UI for user interaction.
Backend logic or serverless functions to handle AI processing and API calls.
Integration with Wikipedia’s API to search and extract article content dynamically.
Optionally, natural language processing to interpret user questions and map them to Wikipedia topics.
This approach allows your AI to provide up-to-date, sourced knowledge directly from Wikipedia while maintaining a personalized learning experience.

Here is an enhanced version of a personal learning AI chatbot website that integrates Wikipedia content dynamically using the Wikipedia API. The chatbot fetches summaries from Wikipedia based on user queries and displays them in the chat interface.

Features are added: 

1. Wikipedia API integration to fetch article summaries.
2. AI attempts to answer user queries by searching Wikipedia.
3. If no relevant Wikipedia article is found, fallback to predefined AI responses.
4. Text-only interaction with a clean, responsive UI.
5. Maintains conversation history in the session.
